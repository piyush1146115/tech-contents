- [Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ)
    - Software has not changed much at a fundamental level in last 70 years
    - Software 1.0 = code
    - Software 2.0 = fixed function neural nets. weights in neural networks, hugging face is equivalent of github in software 2.0
    - Software 3.0 = LLM = programmable neural net
    - He mentioned about one of his tweet: "The hottest new programming language is English"
    - LLM have properties of Operating systems: LLMs are increasaingly complex software ecosystems, not simple commodities like electricity
    - LLMs are like a new type of OS while claude/openAI are like windows. Ollama is like Linux
    - We are in the mainframe and time-sharing era of computing for LLM
    - Power to the people: How LLMs flip the script on technology diffusion. Billions of people have access to LLMs.
    - LLM has encyclopedic memory
    - Opportunities: Anatomy of Cursor- early LLM Apps
    - Talked about the introduction of the word - vibe coding
    - In vibe coding was the easiest part
    - There is new category of consumer/manipulator of digital information: Human, Computers, Agents(New): computers <- human like
