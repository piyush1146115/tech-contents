### About the Author
William Shotts has been a software professional for more than 30 years and
an avid Linux user for more than 20 years. He has an extensive background
in software development, including technical support, quality assurance,
and documentation. He is also the creator of LinuxCommand.org, a Linux
education and advocacy site featuring news, reviews, and extensive support
for using the Linux command line.

### About the Technical Reviewer
Jordi Gutiérrez Hermoso is a coder, mathematician, and hacker-errant. He
runs Debian GNU/Linux exclusively since 2002, both at home and at work.
Jordi has been involved with GNU Octave, a free numerical computing envi-
ronment largely compatible with Matlab, and with Mercurial, a distributed
version control system. He enjoys pure and applied mathematics, skating,
swimming, and knitting. Nowadays he thinks a lot about environmental
mapping, greenhouse gas emissions, and rhino conservation efforts.

### What This Book Is About
This book is a broad overview of “living” on the Linux command line.
Unlike some books that concentrate on just a single program, such as the
shell program bash, this book will try to convey how to get along with the command line interface in a larger sense. How does it all work? What can it
do? What’s the best way to use it?

### Who Should Read This Book
This book is for new Linux users who have migrated from other platforms.
Most likely you are a “power user” of some version of Microsoft Windows.
Perhaps your boss has told you to administer a Linux server, or you’re enter-
ing the exciting new world of single board computers (SBC) such as the
Raspberry Pi. You may just be a desktop user who is tired of all the security
problems and wants to give Linux a try. That’s fine. All are welcome here.

That being said, there is no shortcut to Linux enlightenment. Learning
the command line is challenging and takes real effort. It’s not that it’s so
hard, but rather it’s so vast. The average Linux system has literally thousands
of programs you can employ on the command line. Consider yourself
warned; learning the command line is not a casual endeavor.
On the other hand, learning the Linux command line is extremely
rewarding. If you think you’re a “power user” now, just wait. You don’t know
what real power is yet. And, unlike many other computer skills, knowledge
of the command line is long-lasting. The skills learned today will still be use-
ful 10 years from now. The command line has survived the test of time.
It is also assumed that you have no programming experience, but don’t
worry, we’ll start you down that path as well.

### What’s in This Book

This book is divided into four parts, each covering some aspect of the
command line experience.
- **Part 1**, “Learning the Shell,” starts our exploration of the basic lan-
guage of the command line including such things as the structure of
commands, file system navigation, command line editing, and finding
help and documentation for commands.
- **Part 2**, “Configuration and the Environment,” covers editing configura-
tion files that control the computer’s operation from the command line.
- **Part 3**, “Common Tasks and Essential Tools,” explores many of the ordi-
nary tasks that are commonly performed from the command line. Unix-
like operating systems, such as Linux, contain many “classic” command
line programs that are used to perform powerful operations on data.
- **Part 4**, “Writing Shell Scripts,” introduces shell programming, an
admittedly rudimentary but easy-to-learn technique for automating
many common computing tasks. By learning shell programming, you
will become familiar with concepts that can be applied to many other
programming languages.
