# Instrumentation

The largest payoffs you will get from Prometheus are through instrumenting your own applications using direct instrumentation and a client library. 

You will also need to install the latest Python client library. This can be done with pip
install prometheus_client. The instrumentation examples can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus-up-and-running/examples/tree/master/3).
